            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

            <p>Voidling is a Tamagotchi-style pet simulation game for iOS and Apple Watch. We built it to be fun, not to harvest your data. Here is the short version: <strong>we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information.</strong></p>

            <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>None. Voidling does not collect personal data, usage analytics, or device identifiers. There are no accounts, no logins, and no tracking of any kind.</p>

            <h2>Local Storage</h2>
            <p>Your game state (creature stats, evolution progress, Void Shards balance) is stored entirely on your device using Apple's UserDefaults and App Groups. This lets the iOS app, Apple Watch app, and widgets stay in sync. None of this data ever leaves your device.</p>

            <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
            <p>Voidling offers optional In-App Purchases (Void Shards) handled entirely through Apple's StoreKit framework. All transaction processing is managed by Apple. We do not receive or store any payment information.</p>

            <h2>Notifications</h2>
            <p>Voidling can send local notifications to let you know when your creature needs attention. These are scheduled on-device and do not involve any external server. No push notification service is used.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Voidling does not include any third-party SDKs, analytics frameworks, ad networks, or external services. The app makes no network requests aside from Apple's own App Store and StoreKit infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Voidling is suitable for all ages. Since we do not collect any personal data from anyone, this naturally extends to children. There is nothing to worry about here.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>If this policy ever changes, we will update this page and the date above. Given that we collect nothing, changes are unlikely.</p>
